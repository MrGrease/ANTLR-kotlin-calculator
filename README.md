# Description:
The aim of this project is to build a command line application that takes two paths as arguments, one for input and one for output. The input text file is then read line by line and each line is parsed through ANTLR. ANTLR (Another tool for language recognition) parses the lines according to a grammar that is written up. The grammar defines how the text lines will be split up into a tree. The tree is then used by the Kotlin app and a helper class. The helper class uses a “visitor” pattern to “visit” each node in the tree recursively until every operation (+,- ,*,/) between given numbers is completed. The Kotlin app then writes evaluated line into the specified output file, if there are syntax errors, the whole text file is scrapped and an error message (Syntax error at line X) is printed instead of the outputs.
This program uses Maven, the pom file contains all the required dependencies for this project.
